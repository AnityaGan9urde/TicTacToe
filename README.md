# TicTacToe
This is the game for TIC TAC TOE which has a UI based on the Tkinter platform.
The code is taken from the book "Python Projects" by Laura Cassell and Alan Gauld.
This code is not written by me but belongs to the authors. 
This is just a practice code for using python and pushing it to Github.
All the documentation is done be me by referring the book.
Enjoy the game!
